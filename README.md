You will need to get api key from threads and twitter

bluesky doesn't require a api key

They way that this works is you make a post on bluskey and it will crosspost to the other sites, I have this running as a cronjob every 30 minutes.

So far this does not work with media, only text.


pip install -r requirements.txt
